# Eurorack KiCad Templates

## Hark and rejoice! ##

Herein you shall find a small collection of KiCad templates for Eurorack panels and PCBs. PCBs are fairly basic--largely edgecuts and mounting holes--but will save time in project setup. I plan to gradually build this project out over the coming months.

Dimensions are based largely on the [Doepfer standard](https://doepfer.de/a100_man/a100m_e.htm). Please observe that the leftmost mounting holes 7.5mm from the left edge of the panel. The position of the right mounting holes from the left are calculated thusly: `((hp-3)*5.08)+7.5`. This is in accordance with the Doepfer standard as I understand it. The mounting holes are oval; 3.2mm high and 7mm wide for a high level of spacing tolerance. Too much tolerance? Let me know. 2hp panels differ in that the mounting hole widths are 6mm.

To use these templates, simply move these directories to your KiCad user templates directory, or point the `KICAD_USER_TEMPLATE_DIR` path to a folder containing them. Alternatively, you may browse for folders containing them (e.g., `../panels`) on the **New Project from Template...** folder browser dialog. 

**NOTE:** The future is *now*! Templates are providedin the brand-spanking new KiCad 6.0 format.
